One Dimensional cellular automata implemented in VHDL.  Runs on 
the Xilinx Spartan3 Starter kit board.

Slider switches used to set the rule:  There are 8 possibilities for next 
state when any bit is compared with it's neighbors.  So for example,
Rule 1 (right-most slider switch set to 'on'):

000 -> 1 (lsb)
001 -> 0
010 -> 0
011 -> 0
100 -> 0
101 -> 0
110 -> 0
111 -> 0 (msb)

Rule 9 would be: 

000 -> 1 (lsb)
001 -> 0
010 -> 0
011 -> 1
100 -> 0
101 -> 0
110 -> 0
111 -> 0 (msb)


Generation count displayed on the 4 seven segment LEDs.

BTN0 is the reset. After pressing reset, the initial state is the value
of the rule switches.

TODO: come up with a way to select a different start value optionally.
Perhaps this could be done via one of the other pushbuttons.
Perhaps the desired rule could be set on the slider switches, then 
reset pushed, and then the slider switches could be set to a different
start value after a different pushbutton is pushed?  that could get
trickey.
